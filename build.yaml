# This file generates the GitHub Actions matrix.
# For simple board + shield combinations, add them to the top level board and
# shield arrays, for more control, add individual board + shield combinations
# to the `include` property. You can also use the `cmake-args` property to
# pass flags to the build command, `snippet` to add a Zephyr snippet, and
# `artifact-name` to assign a name to distinguish build outputs from each other:
#
#board: ["nice_nano_v2"]
#shield: ["zsofle_left", "zsofle_right"]
include:
  - artifact-name: zSofle
  #   - board: bdn9_rev2
  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: "zsofle_left"

  - board: nice_nano_v2
    shield: "zsofle_right"
#   - board: nice_nano_v2
#     shield: corne_left
#     snippet: studio-rpc-usb-uart
#     cmake-args: -DCONFIG_ZMK_STUDIO=y
